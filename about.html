        <h1>Student | Programmer | Researcher</h1>
        &emsp;I'm Marlon Figueroa, a programmer currently residing in Westchester, New York. Mostly self taught, I have been avidly programming since middle school.
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp;I'm currently formalizing my studies by majoring in Computer Science at Lehman College as a member of their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lehman.edu/undergraduate-bulletin/thelehmanscholarsprogram_0.htm">Scholars Program</a>. 
				In addition to being a student, I'm also an undergraduate researcher for the <a href="https://www.rfcuny.org/RFWebsite/">CUNY Research Foundation</a>. 
				My research is focused on the statistical analysis and visualization of non-Euclidean treespace. The majority of my work is in adapting <a target="_blank" href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/owen/">Megan Owen’s</a> previous work into a standalone, cross platform software package. From the very beginning, I’ve been designing the program’s behaviour, flow, and appearance to make her codebase much more accessible. My goal is to facilitate applications of the program in biomedical imaging and evolutionary biology.
				Previously, I studied computational complexity theory and its applications with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/mjohnson/">Matthew P. Johnson</a> at the CUNY Graduate Center.
		<br>
        <br>
		&emsp;Past education includes Fox Lane High School from which I graduated with Honors in the Spring of 2013.
        At Fox Lane I used my programming ability to lead the school's Robotics Club, and create a Computer Science Club.
        <blockquote>
		<br>In the Robotic's club I lead multiple teams and was elected Vice President. Memorable moments in the club are when we competed in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalroboticschallenge.org/joomla/">National Robotics Challenge</a>. I personally took part in the Mazebot, and Mini Sumo events, and assisted the Heavy Weight Sumo team.
        <br>
		<br>In the Computer Science Club I acted as Vice President and then President. Notable achievement of the new club was the development of Fox Lane's <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flhs-info/id656392819?ls=1&mt=8">first official app</a>.

       &emsp;Though programming is my passion, I've recently taken up Graphic Design as a hobby. As a non-artist, graphic design is the perfect mix between the functionality of code and the aesthetics of art. Careful attention to content layout, proper typography, and pleasing color palettes has allowed me to improve my web design. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp;Another interest of mine is Languages. My native tongue is Spanish, and English is my Second language. Nonetheless, I'm fluent in both. My third language, French, I studied for 6 years. I have recently begun learning Japanese which will be my Fourth language.
